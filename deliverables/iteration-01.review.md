## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct 13 2018
 * Where: BA 2210

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

2. Shift the focus of project from attendence signup to in class interaction.
	* We came up with the idea that a lot of students have difficulties of asking questions in class, so we believe this decision can let our app really solve problems and help others. 
1. Use google map for taking attendence.
	* First we come up with the idea which uses Bluetooth technology to do attendance sign-up. We researched and found it could be very difficult to implement. We decide to use google map for this task since almost everyone have GPS and map service on their cellphone.
4. Add a new feature of lecture content understanding(in-class quiz).
	* Professors can ask students to what extend that they understand the topic and students can use multiple choice to give reponse, and our app will give a calculation of percentage, to give professors an idea of students understanding.
3. Build a mobile app for both teaching staff and students clients
	* After knowing each other, we figure that all of us prefer to use Java in this project, so it would be convenient for us to build an Android app. Also, students usually bring their phone to lectures, so we will build mobile clients as our MVP.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Idea of Bluetooth connection for taking attendence.
	* We found that Bluetooth connection can only connect to up to 6 people and doesn't work for a lot of people, so it would take considerably long time for every one to signup. 
2. Dating app
	* Originally we wanted to make a dating app like tinder or bachelor, but it turned out not to be very interesting and wasn't agreed by all of the group members.
3. Travel safety app
	* We discussed about an app for people to record their emergency calls and destination when they are travelling alone, but we found there are many similar apps in store and even in uber itself, so this idea is given up.


#### Planned changes

* We haven't decided to make any changes yet.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 * Decide to solve the problem of asking questions in class, and taking attendence.
 * We choose Android as the platform. We might need to use tools like Android Studio, IntelliJ and Postgres as well.
 * After discussion we decide to mainly focus on the in class interaction instead of attendence signup.
 * Consider to add a new feature of lecture content understanding(in-class pop quiz).
 * Discussed the software design principles and OOP principles which can be implemented.
 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We haven't discussed what kind of design patterns we are going to use. We just decided what our app will be like, so we will get to this topic in the next iteration when we start to implement this app.

## Meeting Highlights

1. Discuss on details about MVP: what features should be built first and how to build these features
2. Discuss the overall framework of this project. Draw a more specific UML diagram.
3. Distribute workloads to every group member based on their skills and background
