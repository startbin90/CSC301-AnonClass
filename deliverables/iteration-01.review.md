 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct 13 2018
 * Where: BA 2210

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

2. Shift the focus of project from attendence signup to in class interaction.
	* We came up with the idea that a lot of students have difficulties of asking questions in class, so we believe this decision can let our app really solve problems and help others. 
1. Use google map for taking attendence.
	* We decide to use google map for this task. Since almost everyone can connect to map through their cellphone, this decision would be successful.
4. Add a new feature of lecture content understanding.
	* Professors can ask students to what extend that they understand the topic and students can use multiple choice to give reponse, and our app will give a calculation of percentage, to give professors an idea of students understanding.
3. Build a mobile app for both teaching staff and students clients
	* After knowing eachother, we figure that all of us prefer to use java in this project, so it would be convenient for us to create an Android app. Also, students usually bring their phone to lectures, so mobile app should be successful.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

1. Idea of blue tooth connection for taking attendence.
	* We found that blue tooth connection can only connect to up to 6 people and doesn't work for a lot of people, so it would take considerably long time for every one to signup. 
2. Dating app
	* Originally we wanted to make a dating app like tinder or bachelor, but it turned out not to be very interesting and wasn't agreed by all of the group members.
3. Travel safety app
	* We discussed about an app for people to record their emergency calls and destination when they are travelling alone, but we found there are many similar apps in store and even in uber itself, so this idea is given up.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* We haven't decided to make any changes yet.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 * Decide to solve the problem of asking questions in class, and taking attendence.
 * Platform to be Android, so we need to use Android Studio, IntelliJ, Postgres.
 * After discussion we decide to mainly focus on the in class interaction, and then attendence signup.
 * Consider to add a new feature of lecture content understanding.
 * Discussed the software design principles and OOP principles.
 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We haven't discussed what kind of design patterns we are going to use. We just decided what our app will be like, so we will get to this topic in the next iteration when we start to implement this app.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
1. Discuss on details about MVP: what features should be built first and how to build these features
2. Discuss the overall framework of this project. Draw a more specific UML diagram.
3. Distribute workloads to every group member based on their skills and background
