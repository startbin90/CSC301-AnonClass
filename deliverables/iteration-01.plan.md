## Iteration 01

 * Start date: September 24
 * End date: October 8

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product


#### Goals and tasks

 Goal: 
 * Each group member should get to know other members. 
 
 * Come up an idea of what kind of problem is our product solving. What platform is it? What purpose does it serve, etc. The more specific our idea is, the better plan we can make based on it.
 (After some discussions, all team members agree to build a software that focuses on the problem that it is quite difficult for instructors to take attendance from students manually in a big lecture. We decided to build our software on the feature that can let students take attendance electronically. The specific approach is not yet discussed. Other features are still possible.)
 
 * Decide what software tools we are using to build our project. For example, which tools do we use to build the backend and which to use to build to frontend.
 
 * Decide which features are we going to be the most focus on. What makes our product different	than any other similar products.
 
 * Discuss how we can apply software design principles and OOP principles into the project.

 * Know a bit more about design patterns. Think about which specific design patterns we can make use of and how to implement those.
 
 * Give a proper name to the software.

 Tasks:
 * Each group member should give his own idea of this project. After discussion, we should be able to have an idea that everybody agrees with. 
 
 * Understand each other's background. Make sure coChoose software tools which most of the group members are familiar with, and they must be able to achieve our project. If this is not possible, we need to figure out what we need to learn.
 
 * Make good use of all ideas during the brainstorming session. For example, if some ideas were voted down during discussion, we can still use them as some extra features.

 * Each person should review software design patterns, principles and OOP principles. 


#### Artifacts

* Record every meeting ever happened. Record the main breakthrough we make after the discussion. Also record the members who attends and who does not. This helps us keep track of who are the most involved and who are the least involved.
 * Created a Wechat group for us to discuss project ideas and to plan future meetings
 * Created Google doc which allows us to operate on a shared file at the same time
 * Making a XML Diagram for Deliverable 1. Here is the link: https://go.gliffy.com/go/share/s0wg4y9w6x2diduc3trs
 * User stories
    * User story #1: As Kate(a student), I want to ask questions in ECO100 class which has a capacity of 500, so that I can  learn well in this class.
    * User story #2: As Sam(a teaching assistant of BIO130), I want to clear the confusions about the tons of terms, so that I can help the students to get more from the class.
    * User story #3: As Joseph(a instructor of MAT246), I donâ€™t want to be interrupted when I deliver the part of proof, but I still want the students to be able to understand the concepts I covered in class.
