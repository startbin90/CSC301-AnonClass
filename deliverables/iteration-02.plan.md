#### Artifacts
     
 1. A to-do list that keeps track of what's left to be done and who's responsible for that.
 	* Every week we will assign work to members in the discussion meeting. In the group coding session on Saturday, we will discuss what's done and what's not yet finished. And then, we will reassign work based on the amount of work left.
 	* work on the back-end is prioritized and need more hands since the person who work on the front-end is an experienced developer and we want to make sure that the back-end is able to provide needed datas.
 	* We would like a team member to focus on one side of the project as much as possible. For example, If a back-end job is not finished, we want a team member who’s also working on back-end to cover that.
 

#### Git / GitHub workflow
 

Every group member forks their own copy of repo in their repository. Since we hope every member to work on different files, it's easy to manage conflicts. If some changes are made, this member will make a pull request and all of the team members can view and merge this request.

We choose this workflow so every member can make their contribution easily.
It’s easy to manage conflicts since everyone’s working on different files.
The master repo will be safer since a pull request must be viewed prior to merge.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * We must have a specific view of the entire structure of the software. How communications are made between clients and server, between server and database. How to implement these.
 * Initialize android workplace. Activities for basic usage of this app such as log in, sign up, enroll courses, create courses, open discussions, review and answer posted questions should be out as soon as possible.
 * Database schema must be implemented. We must use this schema to set up either a local or cloud database.
 * Make sure progress is made in back-end. If back-end can not support some certain functionalities, we will have to use dummies for the demonstration purposes. 

#### Artifacts

 * A diagram to specify the structure:
